      Climate change threatens biodiversity across multiple ecosystems.
      Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns force species
      to migrate or adapt. Conservation efforts must address these challenges
      through habitat protection and emission reduction strategies.
    expected:
      semantic:
        key_themes: ["climate change", "biodiversity", "conservation"]
        related_concepts: ["ecosystems", "temperatures", "species", "habitat"]
    notes: "Environmental topic with interconnected concepts"

      As a board-certified cardiologist with 20 years of clinical experience,
      I have personally treated over 10,000 patients. According to my research
      published in the New England Journal of Medicine, this treatment protocol
      shows promise for reducing cardiovascular risk.
    expected:
      ethos:
        authority_markers: ["board-certified", "20 years", "clinical experience", "10,000 patients"]

      Studies show that participants who exercised 30 minutes daily reduced
      their risk of heart disease by 40%. Furthermore, meta-analyses of 50
      trials confirm these findings with p < 0.001. Therefore, regular exercise
      represents a cost-effective intervention strategy.
    expected:
      logos:
        evidence_markers: ["studies show", "meta-analyses", "trials", "p < 0.001"]
        logical_connectors: ["furthermore", "therefore"]
        statistical_claims: ["40%", "30 minutes", "50 trials"]
