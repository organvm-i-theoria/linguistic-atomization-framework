## Notes

Gummere's translation attempts to preserve the alliterative verse style of the original Old English, with strong stresses and alliteration rather than rhyme. This makes it valuable for studying Germanic poetic conventions.

The poem survives in a single manuscript that was damaged in a 1731 fire. It represents a blend of pagan Germanic heroic tradition with Christian elements added by later scribes.

The Old English text (Harrison-Sharp edition) includes editorial apparatus and glossary, with the actual poem text beginning around line 500.
