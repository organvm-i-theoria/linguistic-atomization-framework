Public domain. The original work is medieval; this translation was published in 1867.

## Notes

Longfellow's translation is notable for preserving Dante's terza rima scheme (ABA BCB CDC...) as closely as possible in English. This makes it valuable for studying how verse form affects rhetorical structure.

The Inferno uses an elaborate allegorical structure:
- 9 circles of Hell (plus vestibule and center)
- Contrapasso: punishments mirror sins
- Political and personal commentary woven throughout

The text includes Longfellow's extensive notes and commentary, which appear after the main poem. These provide context for medieval Italian politics and classical references.

Part of the complete Divine Comedy trilogy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso).
