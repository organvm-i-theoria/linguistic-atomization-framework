prefacp: 


Among the priceless teachings that 
may be found in the great Hindu poem 
of the Mahdbhdratciy there is none so rare 
and precious as this, “The Lord’s Song.” 
Since it fell from the Divine lips of Shri 
Krishna on the field of battle, and stilled 
the surging emotions of His disciple and 
friend, how many troubled hearts has it 
quieted and strengthened, how many 
weary souls has it led to His Feet. It is 
meant to lift the aspirant from the lower 
levels of renunciation where objects are 
renounced, to the loftier heights where 
desires are dead, and where the Yogi 
dwells in calm and ceaseless contempla- 
tion, while his body and mind are actively 
employed in discharging the duties that

filll lo his lot in life. That the 3piritual 
man need not be a reclus^, that union 
with the Divine Life may be achieved 
and maintained in the midst of worldly 
affairs, that the obstacles /o that union 

lie not outside us but within us—such is 

* 

the central lesson of the Uiiagavad GitA. 

It is a Scripture of Yoga: now Yoga is 
literally Union, and it means harmony 
with the Divine Law, the becoming one 
with the Divine Life, by the subdual of 
all outward-going energies. To reach 
this, balance must be gained, equilibrium, 
so that the self, joined to the Self, shall 
not be affected by pleasure or pain, desire 
or aversion, or any of the “pairs of oppo- 
sites ” between which untrained selves 
swing backwards and forwards. ' Modera- 
tion is therefore the key-note of the GitA, 
and the harmonising of all the constituents 
of man, till they vibrate in perfect attune- 
nient with the One, the Supreme SEtF. 
This is the aim the disciple is to set before

him. He must learn not to be attracted 
by the attj^active, nor repelled by the 
repellent, but must see both as manifesta- 
tions of the one Lord, so that they may 
be lessons for^his guidance not fetters, for 
his bondage. In the midst of turmoil he 
must rest in the Lord of Peace, discharg- 
ing every duty to the fullest, not because 
he seeks the results of his actions, but 
because it is his duty to perform them. 
His heart is an altar, love to his Lord the 
flame burning upon it ; all his acts, phy- 
sical and mental, are sacrifices oflTered on 
the altar; and once offered, he has with 
them no further concern. They ascend 
to the Lotus Feet of tshvara, and, 
changed by the fire, they retain no bind- 
ing force on the Soul. 

As though to make the lesson more 
impressive, it was given on a field of 
battle# Arjuna, the warrior-prince, was 
to vindicate his brother’s title, to destroy 
a usurper who was oppressing the land ; 



Vlll 


PREFACE. 


it was his duty as prince, as warrior, to 
fight for the deliverance of hi^ nation and 
to restore order and peace. To make the 
contest more bitter, loved comrades and 
friends stood on both sides,*. wringing his 
heart with personal anguish, afid making 
a conflict of duties as well as physical 
strife. Could he slay those to whom he 
owed love and duty, and trample on ties 
of kindred ? To break family ties was a 
sin ; to leave the people in cruel bondage 
was a sin ; where was the right way ? 
Justice must be done, else law would be 
disregarded ; but how slay without sin ? 
The answer is the burden of the book : 
Have no personal interest in the event ; 
carry out the duty imposed by the posi- 
tion in life ; realise that Ishvara, at once 
Lord and Law, is the Doer, working out 
the mighty evolution that ends in bliss 
and peace; be identified with Hip by 
devotion, and then perform duty as duty, 
fighting without passion or desire, with-

out anger or hatred ; thus activity forges 
no bonds, Yoga is accomplished, and the 
Soul is fred. • 

Such is the obvious teaching of this 
sacred book^ But as all the acts of an 
Avatara Are symbolical, we may ’pass 
from the outer to the inner planes, and 
see in the field of Kurukshetra the battle- 
field of the Soul, and in the sons of 
Dritarashtra enemies it meets in its pro- 
gress; Arjuna becomes the type of the 
struggling Soul of the disciple, and Shri 
Krishna is the Logos of the Soul. Thus 
the teaching of the ancient battlefield 
gives guidance in all later days, and 
trains the aspiring Soul in treading the 
steep and thorny Path that leads to 
Peace. To alt such Souls in East and 
West come these Divine lessons, for the 
Path js one, though it has many names, 
and all Souls seek the same goal, though 
they may not realise their unity.

PKlilACli. 


In order to gain something ol the pre- 
cision of the Sanskrit, a few technical 
but fairly familiar terms hav^ been given 
in the original; Manas is thus retained, 
and may be explained for non-Theosophical 
readers as meaning Mindf bjpth in the 
lower mental processes in which it Is 
swayed by the senses, by passions and 
emotions, and in the higher processes of 
reasoning; Buddhi is the faculty above 
the ratiocinating mind, and is the Pure 
Reason, exercising the discriminative 
faculty of Intuition, of spiritual discern- 
ment; if these words are translated in 
various ways in different passages, aS' 
heatt, mind, understanding, etc., etc>, 
the Bhagavad GitA loses much of its prac- 
tical value as a treatise on Yoga, and the 
would-be learner becomes confused- The 
adjectival ending “ ic” is used in forming 
adjectives from Sanskrit nouns, although 
its use is sometimes a barbarism. * Thus 
Rajasic is used for Rajasa. 



PREFACE. 


XI 


To further aid the careful student, ori- 
ginal terms are sometimes added in foot- 
notes, where they* seem to clarify the 
meaning. The epithets applied to Shrl 
Krishna and Arjuna — the variety of which 
is so characteristic of Sanskrit conversa- 
tion — are for the most part left untrans- 
lated, as being musical they thus add to 
the literary charm, whereas the genius of 
English is so different from tliat of Sans- 
krit, that the many-footed epithets become 
sometimes almost grotesque in translation. 
Names derived from that of an ancestor, 
as P^rtha, meaning the son of Prithfi, 
Kaunteya, meaning the son of Kunti, are 
used in one form or tlie other, according 
to the rhythm of the sentence. One 
other trifling matter, which is yet not 
trifling if it aids the student ; when Atm& 
means^the One Self, the Sei.f of all, it is 
printed in small capitals; where it means 
the lower, the personal self, it is printed 
in ordinary type; this is done because

there is sometimes a play on the word, 
and it is difficult for an untrained reader 
to follow the meaning without* some such 
assistance. 

My wish, in adding this tVagslation to 
those already before the pul)lic, was to 
preserve the spirit of the original, espe- 
cially in its deeply devotional tone, while 
at the same time giving an accurate trans- 
lation, reflecting the strength and the 
terseness of the Sanskrit. In order that 
mistakes, due to my imperfect knowledge, 
might be corrected, all of this translation 
has passed through the hands of one or 
other of the following gentlemen — friends 
of mine at Benares — to whom I here 
tender my grateful acknowledgments : 
Babus Pramada Das Mittra, Ganganath 
Jha,KaliCharan Mittra, and Upendranath 
Basil, A few of the notes are also due 

to them. *

For I desire not victory, O Krishna,

Those for whose sake we desire king-

It is not proper to kill the sons of 
Dhritar^shtra, our relatives ; for how, 
killing oj[ir kinsmen, may we be happy, O 
Madhava ? (37) 

Although these, with intelligence over- 
powered by greed, see no guilt in the 
destruction of a family, no crime in hostility 
to friends, (38) 

Why should we not learn to turn away 
from such a sin, O Janardana, seeing the 
evils in the destruction of a family ? (39) 
In the destruction of a family the 
immemorial family Dharmas*^ perish; in 
the perishing of Dharma, lawlessness over- 
comes the whole family ; (40)

The righteous, who eat the remains of 
the sacrifice, are freed from all sins ; but 
the impious, who dress food for their own 
sakes, they verily eat sin. (13) 

From food creatures become ; from rain 
is the production of food ; rain proceedeth 
from sacrifice ; sacrifice ariseth out of 
action ; (14) 

Know thou from Brahma^ action 
groweth, and Brahma from the Imperish- 
able cometh. Therefore Brahman, the 
all-permeating, is ever present in sacrifice. 

(15) 

He who on earth doth not follow the 
wheel thus revolving, sinful of life and 
rejoicing in the senses, he, O son of 
Prith&, liveth in vain. {16) 

But the man verily who rejoiceth in the 
Self, with the Self is satisfied, and is 
content in the Self, for him there is 
nothing to do; (17)

shouldst perform action. (20>

I^t no wise man unsettle the mind of 
ignorant people attached to action ; but 
acting in harmony (with Me) let him 
render all action attractive* (26) 

Actions are wrought by the energies of 
Nature only. The self, deluded by 
egoism,^ thinketh : “ I am the doer.” (27)

Even the man of knowledge acteth

Having attained to the worlds of the

eternal years, he who fell from Yoga is 
reborn in a pure and blessed house ; (41) 
Or else he is born into a family of in- 
telligent Yogis ; but such a birth as that 
is hard to obtain in this world. (42) 
There he obtaineth the complete yogic 
wisdom belonging to his former body, and 
then again laboureth for perfection, O joy 
of the Kurus ! (43) 

By that former practice he is involun- 
tarily guided. Only wishing to know 
Yoga, one goeth beyond the Brahmic 
word,* (44) 

But the Yogi, verily, labouring with 
assiduity, purified from sin, fully perfected 
through manifold births, he treadeth the 
supreme Path. (45)

They who worship the Gods go to the 
Gods ; to the Pitris go the Pitri-wor- 
shippers ; to the Bhutas go those who 
sacrifice to Bhutas but My worshippers 
come unto Me. (25) 

He who ofiereth to Me with devotion a 
leaf, a flower, a fruit, water, that I accept 
from the purified self, offered as it is with 
devotion. (26) 

Whatsoever thou doest, whatsoever 
tliou eatest, whatsoever thou offerest, 
whatsoever thou givest, whatsoever thou 
doest of austerity, O Kaunteya ! do thou 
as an offering unto Me. (27) 

Thus shalt thou be liberated from the 
bands of actions of good and evil fruits ; 
thyself knit to the Yoga of renunciation, 
thou shalt come unto Me when set free.

this race was generated. (6) 

He who knows in essence that sover-

I am the Generator of all ; all evolves

Sattva, Rajas, Tamas, such are the

tructible Dweller in the body. (5) 

Of these Sattva, from its stainlessness 
luminous and healthy, bindeth by the 
attachment to bliss and the attachment to 
wisdom, O sinless one. (6) 

Rajas, having the nature of passion, 
know thou, is tlie source of the attachment 
to the thirst for life, O Kaunteya, that 
bindclh the Dweller in the body by the 
attachment to action. (7) 

But Tamas, know thou, born of un- 
wisdom, deludeth all Dwellers in the body; 
that bindeth by negligence, indolence and 
sloth, O Bharata. (8) 

Sattva attacheth to bliss, Rajas to 
action, O Bharata. Tamas, verily having 
shrouded wisdom, attacheth on the con-

Darkness, stagnation and negligence

increase of Tanias, O joy of the Kurus. 

(13) 

If Sattva verily prevaileth when a man 
goeth to dissolution, then he goeth forth 
to the spotless worlds of supreme know- 

l«dge. (14) 

Having gone to dissolution in Rajas, he 
is born among those attached to action 
if dissolved in Tamas, he is born in the 
wombs of the deluded. (15) 

It is said the fruit of a good action is 
S&ttvic and spotless ; verily the fruit of

Kajas is pain, and the fruit of Tanias

From Satlva wisdom is born, and also

are of Tanias and also unwisdom. (17) 
They rise upwards who are settled in 
Sattva ; the Rajasic dwell in the midmost

belief, (6) 

Verily renunciation of actions that are 
prescribed is not proper ; the abandon- 
ntellt thereof from delusion is said to be 
t 4 masic. (7) 

He who abandoneth an action from fear 
of physical suiFering, saying, “Painful,” 
(thus) performing a riljasic abandonment, 
obtaineth not the fruit of Abandonment.

He* who sayinjjf, “ It ought to be done,*' 
perforiiieth iin ordaintd action, O Arjuna, 
abandoning .iLtachmcnt and also fruit, 
that Abandoiiinont is n‘garde(l as sattvic. 

( 9 ) 

Tlio abandoncr pervaded by Sattva, in- 
telligent and with doubts cut away, liateth 
not unplcasurable action nor is attached 
to pleasurable. (lo) 

An (‘inbodied being is unable com- 
pletely to abandon actions ; verily he 
who abandoneth the fruit of action he is 
said to be an Abandoncr. (ii) 

(jood, evil and mixed * threefold is the 
fruit t»f action hereafter for the non- 
Abandoncr; but there is none ever for 
the l^enoiinccr. 

These five causes, O mighty-armed, 
learn ol Me as declared in the SAnkhya 
for the accomplishment of all actions —

various kinds, and the (presiding) deities 
also, the fifth. (14) 

Whatever action a man pcrformetli by 
liis body, speech and mind,^ whether 
right or the opposite, these five are its 
causer. (r^) 

That being so, he verily who looketh 
on his Self, which is isolated, as the 
actor, owing to untrained discriminative 
faculty, he,*^ of perverted intelligence, 
seeth not. (16) 

He who is free from the egoistic notion, 
whose discriminative faculty is purr , 
though he slay these peoples, he slayeth 
not, nor is bound. (17) 

Knowledge, what is the known and the 
knower, the threefold impulse to action ; 
the organ, the action, the actor, the three- 
fold constituents of action. (18) 

Knowledge, action and actor are said

(25) 

Liberated from attachment and not

that actor is called sattvic. (26) 

Passionate, desiring to obtain the fruh

That which knowetli action and in-

That by which one understandeth awry

rajasic. (31) 

That which, enwrapped in darkness, 
thinketh Adharma to be Dharma, and 
(sceth) all things perverted, that Buddhi, 
O Partha, is tamasic. (32) 

The firmness, unflinching through 
Yoga, by which one restrainetli the actions 
of Manas, of the life-breaths and of the 
sense-organs, that firmness, O Partha, is 
sattvic. (33) 


* Right and W rong in the widest sense.

The firmness, O Arjuna, by which 
one holdeth fast Dharrna, pleasure and 
wealth, (and is) from attachment de- 
sirous of fruit, that firmness, O Par Ilia, 
is rajasic. (34) 

, That by which a slow-witted person 
doth not abandon sleep, fear, j:(ricf, and 
also stupidity, that firmness, O Parlha, 
is tamasic. (35) 

And now" the threefold kinds of pleasure 
hear thou from Me, O bull of the Bharatas ; 
that in which one by practice rejoiceth, 
and which putteth an end to pain ; (36) 

Which at first is nauseous but in the 
end is as the nectar of immortality ; that 
pleasure is said to be sattvic, born of 
the^ serenity (derived) from a knowledge 
of the Self, (37) 

That which at first is as the nectar of 
immortality from the union of the senses 
with the objects of senses, but in the end 
is ^auseous, that pleasure is accounted 
r^jasic. (38) 



THE RHAGAVAD G1Ts\.

That pleasure which at first and in its 
results is delusive of the self, arising from 
sleep, indolence and heedlessness, that is 
declared tamasic. (39) 

There is not an entity, either on the 
earth or again in heaven among the Gods, 
that is liberated from these three qualities 
born of Prakrit i. (40) 

Of Brahmans, Kshattriyas, Vaishyas 
and Shudras, O Parantapa, the Karmas^ 
have been distributed, according to the 
qualities born of their own natures. (41) 
Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, 
forgixQliess and also uprightness, know- 
ledge, experience, piety, are the Brahman- 
Karma, born of his own nature. (42) 
Prowess, boldness, firmness, dexterity, 
and also not flying from battle, generosity, 
the nature of a ruler, are the Kshattriyai- 
Karma, born of his own nature. (43) 

1 “Duty ” might here be used throughout, but 
the word Karma is now well understood and is 
nr.ofre significant ; it is action arising frovA^ the 
nature fashioned by past thoughts and desires! 



EIGHTEENTH DISCOURSE. l6l 

Ploughing, protection of cattle, and 
trade are the Vaishya-Karma, ])orn of his 
own nature. Action of the nature of 
service is the Shuclra-Karina, horn of his 
own nature. (.^4) 

The man reacheth perfection who is 
content in his own Karma. Listen thou 
how perfection is won by him who is 
content in his own Karma. (45) 

That, the forth-giver^ of beings, by 
Whom all This is spread out, by wor- 
shipping Him in his own Karma a man 
winneth perfection. (46) 

Better is one’s own Dharma, though 
destitute of merits, than the well-executed 
Dharma of another. He who doeth the 
Ka!lna laid down by his own nature in- 
curreth not sin. (47) 

Nature-born Karma, O son of Kunti, 
though (attended with) evil, one ought

not to renounce. All undertakings are 
enveloped by evil as fire by smoke. (48) 
He whose Buddhi is everywhere un- 
attached, the self subdued, dead to 
desires, he goeth to the supreme perfec- 
tion of freedom from Karma by Renuncia- 
tion. (49) 

How he who hath attained perfection 
obtaineth Brahman, that highest end of 
wisdom, that learn thou from Me only 
succinctly, O Kaunteya. (50) 

United to Buddhi purified, controlling 
the self by firmness, having renounced 
sound and the other objects of the senses, 
having laid aside passion and hatred, (51)

arrogance, desire, wrath, covetousness, 
devoid of worldly affection and peaceful — 
he is fit to become Brahman. (53) 

Becoming Brahman, serene in the 
Self, he neither grieveth nor desireth ; 
balanced among all beings, he obtaineth 
supreme devotion unto Me. (54) 

By devotion he knoweth Me full}^ what 
I am and what My Essence ; having thus 
known My Essence, he forthwith entereth 
into Me. (55) 

Even performing all actions continually, 
taking refuge in Me, by My grace he ob 
taineth the eternal indestructible Abode. 

(56) 

Abandoning mentally all works in Me, 
I ftiy chief Good, resorting lo Buddhi- 
Yoga, have thy thought ever on Me. (57) 
Thinking on Me, thou shalt conquer 
all Sbstacles by My grace; but if from 
egoism thou wilt not give ear, thou wilt 
bf destroyed utterly. {58)

obtain supreme Peace, the everlasting 
Dwelling- place. (62) 

Thus hath wisdom, most secret all 
secrets, been declared unto thee by Me ; 
having reflected over it fully, then act 
thou as thou desirest. • (63)

fore Me, thou shalt come even to Me. * I 
pledge thee My troth; thou art dear to 
Me. (65) 

Renouncing all Dharmas, come unto 
Me alone for shelter; sorrow not, I will 
liberate thee from all sins. (66) 

This is not to be ever spoken by thee to 
anyone who is without religious austeri- 
ties, nor (to one who) is not devoted, nor 
as Avell (to one) who desiretli not to listen, 
nor yet to him who speaketh evil of Me.

Nor is there any among men who per-

O Dhananjaya? (72)
