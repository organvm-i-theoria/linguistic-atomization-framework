## Notes

Dryden's translation uses heroic couplets (rhyming iambic pentameter pairs), the dominant English verse form of the Restoration period. This makes it useful for studying how translation conventions of different eras affect rhetorical patterns.

The Aeneid was Rome's national epic, commissioned by Augustus Caesar. It combines Greek epic conventions with Roman political messaging.
